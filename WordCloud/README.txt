The code here creates very basic word clouds from word frequency data provided in files

This folder contains 3 files
1. sampleData.dat - a file that has a list of words along with their frequencies
2. wordCloud.py - a python script that reads sampleData.dat and write a html with the wordCloud
3. wordCloud.html - the HTML file for the wordCloud
