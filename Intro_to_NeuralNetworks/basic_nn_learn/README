###Neural Network Learning

Short script to show weight updates and learning in neural networks
Requires Python and Numpy installed on your computer - alternatively try colab.research.google.com

Try the following cases -
Case 1:
w = np.array([-0.1,0.4])
learning_rate = 0.1

Case 2:
w = np.array([-0.1,0.0.5])
learning_rate = 0.1

Case 3:
w = np.array([-0.1,0.5])
learning_rate = 0.2

Which of these work and which of these don't? and why?
