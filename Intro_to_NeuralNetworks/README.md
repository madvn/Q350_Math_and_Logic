## Introduction to Neural Networks
The Python code here implements a simple one layer neural network and its training regimen to classify the MNIST dataset. To simply run the code to just test it without installing anything on your computer, you will first need to sign-up here https://colab.research.google.com, then open this doc https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwFn4NSMbbQXR3YyZzZ5ejNkcU0/view?usp=sharing and then click 'Connect' on the right top corner of the page. Once your request is approved (which should only take a few minutes), you can run the code.
